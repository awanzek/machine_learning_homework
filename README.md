## Resampling Analysis and Modeling
In this analysis, several types of data resampling were used on the existing loan statistical data set.  
These included: 
1. Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Undersampling
4. SMOTEEN Combination (Over and Under) Sampling 

Once the data was resampled, given the selected method, the model was fit to the training data using a logistic regression model. The balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix, and imbalanced classification report were obtained for all datasets in this model type. 

The following are important conclusions on data resampling:

* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?

* Which model had the best recall score?

* Which model had the best geometric mean score?

## Ensemble Learning and Modeling
In this analysis, two types of data classification models were used on the existing loan statistical data set.  
These included: 
1. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
2. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier


The following are important conclusions on ensemble learning:
* Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
* Which model had the best recall score?
* Which model had the best geometric mean score?
* What are the top three features?
